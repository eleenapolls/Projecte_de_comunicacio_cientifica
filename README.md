This project involves implementing a canonical genetic algorithm. I have a subject named Evolutionary algorithms where we were asked to develop the code I have published. Genetic algorithms are used to solve optimization problems and make decisions based on principles inspired by natural selection. They have practical applications in various fields like machine learning, robotics, image processing, and finance. By mimicking evolution, genetic algorithms help find optimal solutions and improve performance in complex problem-solving scenarios.

My work has a lot of imperfections because I did not know much about this topic. Unfortunately, my main limitation was the lack of time. We just had a few days to execute it and It was not clearly enough. I aim to dedicate more time to obtain the best version of it. 

Before beginning this project, I found that reading the following paper greatly aided my understanding of the fundamental concepts behind a genetic algorithm:
G. Rudolph, "Convergence analysis of canonical genetic algorithms," in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 96-101, Jan. 1994, doi: 10.1109/72.265964.
